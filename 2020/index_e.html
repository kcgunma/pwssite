    <h2>About PWS (Privacy Workshop)</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>As the need for big data utilization grows rapidly in Japan
    and overseas, there is a strong need for developing and
    establishing technologies and standards that balance the
    effective use of data while preserving privacy. To achieve this
    goal, it is essential to activate research and development of
    privacy protection technologies in Japan; this can be
    accomplished through active discussions and exchanges among
    academic institutions that promote research and development of
    privacy protection technologies and practitioners in industry
    who are active in the field of data utilization.</p>

    <p>For the above purpose, the Computer Security Special
    Interest Group (CSEC) of the Information Processing Society of
    Japan has established the PWS Organizing Committee and
    co-hosted the “Privacy Workshop (PWS)” with the Security
    Psychology and Trust Special Interest Group (SPT) of the
    Information Processing Society of Japan. The PWS is scheduled
    to be held annually in conjunction with the Computer Security
    Symposium (CSS) and consists of events and sessions focusing
    mainly on privacy protection technologies for facilitating data
    utilization.</p>
