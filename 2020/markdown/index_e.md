## About PWS(Privacy Workshop)
### Overview
As the need for big data utilization grows rapidly in Japan and overseas, 
there is a strong need for developing and establishing technologies and standards that balance the effective use of data while preserving privacy. 
To achieve this goal, it is essential to activate research and development of privacy protection technologies in Japan; 
this can be accomplished through active discussions and exchanges among academic institutions that promote research and development of privacy protection technologies and practitioners in industry 
who are active in the field of data utilization.

For the above purpose, the Computer Security Special Interest Group (CSEC) of the Information Processing Society of Japan
has established the PWS Organizing Committee and co-hosted the "Privacy Workshop (PWS)" 
with the Security Psychology and Trust Special Interest Group (SPT) of the Information Processing Society of Japan. 
The PWS is scheduled to be held annually in conjunction with the Computer Security Symposium (CSS) 
and consists of events and sessions focusing mainly on privacy protection technologies for facilitating data utilization.
