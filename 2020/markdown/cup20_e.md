- Contest Flow
    - The Committee generates "synthetic-data" for each participating team. The "sampled data" is extracted from the "synthetic-data" and distributed to the participating teams.
    - The anonymizer (each team) processes the "sampled-data" and submits the "anonymized-data". If the "anonymized-data" does not meet the specified criteria for utility, it will be disqualified.
    - The attacker (each team) receives a pair of (synthetic-data, anonymized-data) of all anonymizers other than themselves. From the "anonymized-data", the attacker estimated the "sampling data".

- Evaluation
    - Anonymization phase: the total number of successful estimates made by each attacker is deducted from the anonymizer's points, and the anonymizer with the highest score wins
    - Attack phase: the attacker with more success in estimating the sampled data of the winner of the anonymization phase wins.


- Determination of Final Ranking
    - There will be two rounds in this contest, the preliminary and final round, and each round has distribute, anonymize, and attack phase.
    - The results of the scoring in each round will be used to determine the final rankings.
