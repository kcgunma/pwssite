## Rules (overview)
### Story
In the story of PWS Cup 2021, we intend to provide health data that contain diagnostic outcomes to researchers who study to predict risks of acquiring diabetes.  
The data contain records that include extreme high body-mass index (BMI).  
In the anonymization phase, each participating team of the PWS Cup 2021 anonymizes health data in order to prevent identifying medical examinees.  
In the attack phase, each team checks whether anonymized data generated by other teams include their team's records or not. Once the inclusion is detected, identify the record from the anonymized data.  
The winner of the PWC Cup 2021 will be a team that generated the safest and the most useful health data.

## Organizer
PWS Committee in the Computer Security Special Interest Group of the Information Processing Society of Japan  
(PWS Cup 2021 is a co-located workshop with the Computer Security Symposium 2021.)
