### Story
In the story of iPWS Cup 2023, we intend to provide health data that contain diagnostic outcomes to researchers who study to predict risks of acquiring diabetes.  
The data contain records that include extreme high body-mass index (BMI).  
In the anonymization phase, each participating team of the iPWS Cup 2023 anonymizes health data in order to prevent identifying medical examinees.  
In the attack phase, each team checks whether anonymized data generated by other teams include their team's records or not. Once the inclusion is detected, identify the record from the anonymized data.  
The winner of the iPWS Cup 2023 will be a team that generated the most secure and useful health data.
