### Important Notes
- PWS Cup Session will be held within the Computer Security Symposium 2023 (CSS 2023). Therefore, participation (presentation and attendance) in the PWS Cup Session requires registration for CSS 2023.
- PWS Cup Session is planned to be conducted on-site at the CSS 2023 venue. **The screens in the C Venue will be broadcasted via Zoom.**  
  *Poster presentations will not be visible as they will be held outside the venue.*
- Teams participating in PWS Cup 2023 are required to make presentations during the PWS Cup Session, both as presentations and posters. Teams that do not present may not be eligible for awards.

## 2. Presentation
Each team is expected to explain the key points of the methods used in the contest through presentation. Each team's presentation time is 5 minutes, including transition time. Due to the short duration, it is recommended to focus on essential explanations and lead into the poster presentation.

### Important Notes
- There will be no Q&A during the presentation.
- Presentation order will be based on the team ID in ascending order.
- It is not necessary to disclose the organization or participant names (though it's optional).
- Please prepare presentation materials on your laptop. **The presentation material will be projected via Zoom.**

## 3. Poster Presentation
Each team is expected to explain the methods used in the contest through poster presentation. Poster presentations will consist of two parts: the first half and the second half. Teams with odd (even) team IDs will be required to have at least one team member present during the first (second) half of the poster presentation. During other times, you may present or attend other teams' presentations.

### Creating Posters
- The size of the poster paper is flexible, as long as it fits within the display board provided below. You can use one large sheet or multiple smaller sheets.
- Each team is responsible for printing their posters and bringing them to the venue. Printing at the venue is not available.
- Clearly mention the team name and team ID at the top of the poster.  
  - You do not need to include the organization name or participant names (though it's optional).
- Posters can be a printed version of the presentation slides or an extended version.

### Display Method
- Each team will be assigned one display board that can hold an A0 size poster vertically (841mm × 1189mm). Please display your poster on this board.
- Use the provided pushpins for displaying; other methods are prohibited.

### Display Location
- **Display boards will be set up in the outdoor foyer space for PWS Cup Session.**
- Specific allocation of display boards to each team will be communicated later.

### Display Period
- You should display your posters from 1:40 PM on October 30th until the start of the "First Half of Poster Presentations" during the PWS Cup Session.
- Please remove your posters by 12:20 PM on November 2nd.  
  - If you fail to remove them by then, the organizing committee may dispose of the posters.

## 4. Outstanding Presentation Award
The team that delivers the best presentation, taking both presentation and poster presentation into account, will be recognized with the Outstanding Presentation Award. Judging will be conducted by anonymous voting of judges selected by the organizing committee, including the chief judge. The judging criteria are, "The presentation that most effectively conveys the methods used in the contest and contributes the most to the improvement of de-identification and attribute inference technology among the audience." The Outstanding Presentation Award does not preclude other awards in PWS Cup 2023 (teams winning other awards in PWS Cup 2023 are also eligible for the Outstanding Presentation Award).

### 4.1 Selection Process
After the participant presentations and poster presentations at the PWS Cup Session, each judge will select one team that they consider deserving of the Outstanding Presentation Award. An anonymous vote with one vote per judge will then take place. The team with the most votes will receive the Outstanding Presentation Award. In the event of a tie, the chief judge will select one team from among the tied teams to receive the award.
