Dear all

In the CSS 2019 PWS Cup session, each team participating in the PWS Cup 2019 
will be asked to explain their techniques used in the PWS Cup 2019 contest 
as a spotlight oral presentation (i.e., a three-minute oral presentation) and as a poster presentation. 

After the presentations, the judges will vote for the "Best Presenter Award."

The judging criteria are as follows:
- The presentations that explain the methods used in the contest in an easy-to-understand manner 
  and that are considered to have the most contribute to improving the audience's data anonymization and risk assessment techniques.

The voting will be made as follows:
- The team with the most votes by the judges wins the award.
- If the number of votes is the same, the vote by the PWS Cup Organizing Chair will decide the winner.

Spotlight oral presentation:
- The presentation time is 3 minutes for each team (including PC switching). No Q&A.
- If you submit your presentation materials to the PWS Cup committee member before the session date, 
  you can make your oral presentation on the PWS Cup committee member's PC. 
  You can also bring your PC to make your oral presentation on your PC. 
  For details, please refer to "Submission of presentation materials."
- You can make any oral presentation. 
  We encourage you to briefly outline the methods used in the contest to guide the audience to check your poster presentation.
- There are no particular restrictions on the format and number of pages of the presentation slides.

Poster presentation:
- The poster board is 90cm wide and 120cm long, which is large enough to fits an A0 poster. 
   Please bring your own posters.
- We will divide teams into odd-numbered teams and even-numbered teams and assign poster session time for each group.
  For detail, please refer to "Schedule on October 22."
- Please put up your poster at 9:30 to 10:00 or during the break.
- Please focus on the techniques used in the final round. 
  For example, we encourage you to cover the following items (note that this list is just a suggestion. 
  You are not obliged to cover all of them).

(1) How did you anonymize data to make it tolerant to an ID disclosure attack?
(2) How did you anonymize data to make it tolerant to trace inference attack 
    (i.e., did you use the same method as (1) or not)
(3) How did you make an ID disclosure attack?
(4) How did you make a trace inference attack?

- It is optional to cover the methods used in the preliminary round. 
  If your team only attends the preliminary round, however, please explain the methods used in the preliminary round.
